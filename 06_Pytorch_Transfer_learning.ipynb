This means its parameters will be updated during training. In essence, we're using the `features` portion to feed our `classifier` portion a base representation of an image and then our `classifier` layer is going to learn how to base representation aligns with our problem.\n",
        "* **Less trainable parameters** - Previously there was 5,288,548 trainable parameters. But since we froze many of the layers of the model and only left the `classifier` as trainable, there's now only 3,843 trainable parameters (even less than our TinyVGG model). Though there's also 4,007,548 non-trainable parameters, these will create a base representation of our input images to feed into our `classifier` layer.\n",

Freezing the base layers of our model and leaving it with less trainable parameters means our model should train quite quickly.
